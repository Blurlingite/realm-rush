    // We still couldn't hear the death sound effect because in 3D games, audio dies down depending how far away the death was from the Main Camera. So we just needed to pass in the Main Camera's position into the PlayClipAtPoint() method. This will play the death sound effect at the main camera's postion (and since the Main Camera has the Audio Listener component, it can listen to audio being played by an Audio Source)
